  Top 4 best gaming keyboards

  </b1>

<l1> There are tons of gaming keyboards in the market right now, from mechanical to membrane keyboards, 60% to full sized keyboards, theres just too much options.
  In this review, you will go over some of the top five keyboars and maby you will end up buying one. But before you do that, you must know what type of keyboard you want.
  There are mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards. Mechanical keyboards is where there's a switch under the keycap and membrane keyboards is just rubber underneath the keycap. It
  is usually better to go with mechanical keyboards because there are different types of switches you can choose from and in membrane switches, there is just
  rubber which gives a sort of "mushy" feel, it will last a way shorter time and because of the material, and it is very hard to clean. Moving on to mechanical 
  keyboards, switches are different, some have different actuation points which is the key travel distance where the key is actually recognized by the keyboard. 
  So in gaming, it is usually good to have a lower actuation point such as 1.4mm or less because you can have faster reactions. But if you want to 
  use your keyboard for typing, having such low actuation points isnt much of a good idea because you can easily make typo errors.
  But thats not really a big deal because it happens on the first month or 2 when you get the keyboard and you will eventually get used to it.
